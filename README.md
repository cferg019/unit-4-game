# unit-4-game

The goal of the game is to collect the correct amount of gems to match the random number at the top of the page.
<br> 
Each gem will have a random value that is reset each round. 
<br>
As you click on the gems, your score will increase by the assigned value of the gems. 
<br>
<br>
For this game I used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery 
<br>

Enjoy! :gem:
